# **Project Plan -- Team 79**



##1 Introduction

The purpose of this project plan is to guide both the project execution and project control. This will define the work activities, deliverables, and timeline using a waterfall methodology.

Team79 is charged with the development of a software application which will output the averages number of words per sentence from a given article/essay. 

The software is aimed for use with college students. 

The software will allow user to upload the file by input directory path. Also, user are allow to modify delimiter to change the definition of sentence, and modify the minimum length of word to change the calculation in software.


##2 Process Description

**1. Project Planning**

> Project planning is the process in which the team provides the road-map of the activities that need to be completed and which order they are to be completed as well as a time estimate for them. The activities are named, described, and entrance and exit criteria defined.


| *Entrance criteria*          | *Exit criteria*        | 
| :------------ |:---------------| 
| Project Plan Template      | Completed Project Plan Document    | 
| Development Team      | Development Team Roles Assigned |
| Statement of Work     |  |


**2. Elicit Requirements**

> The process of listing user requirements and system requirements. 

> The user requirements would list the possible external system and libraries that might be used in software. Also, user requirements will describe how the system will interact with the user and what the user needs to use the software

> The system requirements will contain functional requirement and non-functional requirement which specify the major purpose of the software and the parameters that might be used to modify the output of software.

| *Entrance criteria*          | *Exit criteria*        | 
| :------------ |:---------------| 
| Completed Project Plan Document      | Requirements Document    | |




**3. Software Design**

> The process of coming up with efficient algorithm/structure of the overall implementation. The solution will be extensible and adaptable.

| *Entrance criteria*          | *Exit criteria*        | 
| :------------ |:---------------| 
| Requirements Document      |  High Level Design    | 




**4. Develop Software**

> The process of designing, developing and unit testing the software using the approved functional and non functional requirements. As part of this process, best practices and quality of code has to be ensured and an initial build of the code is produced.

| *Entrance criteria*          | *Exit criteria*        | 
| :------------ |:---------------| 
| Requirements Document      |  Initial Build    | 



**5. Validate Software**

> The process of validating the final solution against requirements specifications by defining strong functional and non functional test cases and executing manual/automated tests.


| *Entrance criteria*          | *Exit criteria*        | 
| :------------ |:---------------| 
| Initial Build      |  Defects in the Software   | 
|  Test Cases      |  Refined Code   | 

**6. Create User Documentation**

> The process of outlining the critical steps needed in the installation/deployment and configuration of application software. It involves documenting using screenshots/steps the usage guide that will aid the user in successfully using the application. 

> This part will also provide the guidline for error message.

| *Entrance criteria*          | *Exit criteria*        | 
| :------------ |:---------------| 
| Refined Code     |  User Documentation (textual man page)   | 
| Updated Requirements Document     |  Error Message Guide    |


##3 Team

**Team Members**

- Lester Lobo
- Baruch Bhatti
- Yu Sun
- Michael Donaher

**Team Roles**

- *Project Manager*
Role requires planning of activities and resources. Ensures deliverable are defined, estimated and executed in a timely fashion. Works with different members of the team to ensure quality and success of overall project.

- *Development Lead*
Role requires understanding of requirements and outlining the high level design and implementation approach. Involves estimating development effort and 
 
- *QA Manager*
Role requires reviewing the requirements and high level design and articulating a high level test plan , identifying functional and non functional test cases, driving the test execution, status reporting and delivering Test Summary Report
 
- *Documentation Lead*
Role requires creating and documenting various artifacts that would be delivered along with the final software. This documentation would help the end user of the software to deploy, use and maintain.

- *Developer*
Role requires ability to code/develop the final software with hand son  experience in Java Development and Unit Testing.

- *Tester*
Role requires ability to define test cases against the specified functional and non functional requirements, and provide test pass and failure conditions.
